Getting and Cleaning Data----Peer Assessments


The script file is run_analysis.R. 

My steps are as follows:

1) Making a function for processing the given data.

2) Using the function to load the data called train and test

3) Merging the 2 data sets into one new data set

4) Loading the data of activity_labels

5) Merging the 2 new data by activityCode into a final data

6) Processing the final data and save the results as requested.

7) Writing the Readme.md and push the R scripts and Codebook to github

8) Uploading the tiny data set to the coursera submission page.

Thank you for your review and your time.
